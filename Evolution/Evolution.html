            <h2>1769</h2>
            <p>For any automotive history buffs out there, it will come as no surprise that, despite popular opinion, the evolution of the car began much earlier than the usually cited year of 1886. In fact, it began in 1769 with the creation of the first steam-powered automobile that was capable of transporting people. For this, we have Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot to thank. 
            The “steam car” was a pretty large contraption - <u> a far cry from the modern day Hyundai i10, which is known for its compact design </u> - and contained a huge metal steam chamber at the front. It had to stop every ten to fifteen minutes to build up steam.

            <h2>1885</h2>
            <p>A monumental year in the history of automobile evolution, 1885 saw the invention of the first car (excluding Cugnot's contraption). This was all thanks to the creation of the internal combustion engine, a mechanism of transforming fuel into energy that the majority of cars still use today...for now. 
            The first liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine was invented by George Brayton in 1872, and in 1876, Nikolaus Otto, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach patented the compressed charge, four-stroke cycle engine.
            </p>
            
            <p> - Karl Benz created the first car in 1885 and received the patent for it in 1886. It was called the Benz Patent Motor Car. It had three wheels and the design was based on a horse carriage!</p>

            <h2>1908</h2>
            <p>In 1908, something epic happened. Ford started manufacturing the Model T - known affectionately as “tin Lizzie” - which is regarded as the first affordable car. In fact, it became so popular that at one point the majority of Americans owned one. 
            Between 1913 and 1927, Ford produced more than 15 million Model T's</p>

            <h2>1911</h2>
            <p>On June 15th 1911, the electric starting motor was patented by Charles Kettering. Although he didn’t technically invent the motor, his great achievement was making it work in automobiles.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>1930</h2>
            <p>The first stereo was invented in 1930 in monophonic AM frequency, but it would be another 22 years before the first radio capable of receiving an FM frequency was added to a car in 1952.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>1958</h2>
            <p>This is another one that might surprise you; cruise control came about in the 1950s. The system made it easy to drive at a steady speed without using the accelerator. It was first used on a Chrysler Imperial.</p>
        
            <center><img src="Chrysler.jpeg" height="250" width="375"><figcaption><font size=2 color="#fc973f">Chrysler Imperial</font></figcaption></center>
            
            <h2>1970s</h2>
            <p>You’d be forgiven for thinking that parking sensors were a recent invention, but they actually first came around in the 70s as guiding devices for the blind! They gained popularity in the 2000s, though many budget cars still don’t have them.
            The 70s were a bit of a golden age for new advances in car technology, with cassette stereos, ABS systems, catalytic converters and digital dashboard displays also all being introduced.</p>
        
            <h2>1980s</h2>
            <p>The 80s saw the introduction of CD players and airbags to most cars.</p>
            <center><img src="CD_Plater.avif" height="200" width="375"><figcaption><font size=2 color="#fc973f">CD Player</font></figcaption></center>
            
            <h2>2000s</h2>
            <p>Many advancements came about in the noughties, including Bluetooth, GPS Sat-Navs, automatic parking and hybrid cars. </p>
            <center><img src="gps.png" height="200" width="375"><figcaption><font size=2 color="#fc973f">GPS Toolkit/system</font></figcaption></center>
            <p>The first hands-free Bluetooth kit entered the market in 2001. Nowadays, most in-car infotainment systems have Bluetooth integrated as standard.
            Unsurprisingly, it was Toyota that first successfully introduced a hybrid motor to a petrol engine at the turn of the century. As a result, the Prius came into existence and took the world by storm!</p>

            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Automotive technology is evolving at a rapid - and for some, alarming  - rate. Stuff that only a few years ago would have seemed like something straight out of a sci-fi movie has become part of our reality, such as self-driving cars and autopilot features. 
            The Waymo - Google’s self-driving car - completed its first driverless ride on public roads in 2015. And, in April 2021, it was announced that self-driving cars would be allowed on UK roads by the end of the year.</p>
